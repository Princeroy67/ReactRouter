This project is a web application built with React, a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. The main goal of this project is to create different pages that are displayed based on the URL you visit. Here's a simplified description of this project:

Routes: The project has different "routes," which are like pages or sections of the website. Each route is associated with a specific component, which is a part of the web page.

Components: Components are the building blocks of the project. For example, there are components like "Home," "About," "Contact," "User," and "Github." Each of these components represents a different part of the website.

Router: The project uses a routing system provided by the "react-router-dom" library. This router helps determine which component should be displayed based on the current URL. For example, if you visit "example.com/about," the "About" component will be displayed.

Rendering: The project renders the components inside a "root" element in the HTML document. It ensures that the correct component is shown on the webpage based on the URL you visit.







# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
